# Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

# JWT Secret - Generate a strong random string for production
# You can generate one with: openssl rand -base64 32
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Vercel KV (Redis) - Optional but recommended for persistent storage
# Get these from your Vercel dashboard after creating a KV store
# KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-kv-store.upstash.io
# KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-kv-token

# Note: Without KV, achievements will be stored in memory and reset on each deployment
# To enable persistent storage:
# 1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Storage > Create Database > KV
# 3. Connect the KV database to your project
# 4. The environment variables will be automatically set
